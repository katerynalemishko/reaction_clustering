In this notebook, I describe the K-means clustering of the real experimental data. This technique allows
to follow different steps in a mechanochemical reaction.

The data was obtained in experiments carried out by myself using the magnetic tweezers experimental technique (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_tweezers).
